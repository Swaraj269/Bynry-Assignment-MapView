# MapView

Hi Bynry Team,

I’m excited to introduce **MapView**, the feature you requested. I developed it using React and styled it with Tailwind CSS to ensure responsiveness. Let me walk you through the application:

1. **Home Page**: Here, you’ll find multiple user profiles. For now, I’ve limited it to 50 users, but I can scale it up in the future using pagination or infinite scrolling.

2. **Profile Details**: By clicking on any profile, you’ll be directed to a detailed profile page. I implemented this using React Router DOM for dynamic routing.

3. **Data Management**: Instead of inefficient props drilling, I’ve used the Context API to manage state across components. While Redux could be an alternative, I felt it was unnecessary for this small application. However, if the application becomes more complex in the future, I can integrate Redux.

4. **Map Feature**: The highlight of the application is the interactive map, where you can view the user's location. I implemented this using an open-source library called **Leaflet**.

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project. I hope you like the application and look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,  
Swaraj Singh
